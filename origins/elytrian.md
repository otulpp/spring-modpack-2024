# Elytrian

Often flying around in the winds, Elytrians are uncomfortable when they don't have enough space above their head.

## Characteristics

- **Gift of the Winds:** Every 30 seconds, you are able to launch about 20 blocks up into the air.
- **Winged:** You have Elytra wings without needing to equip any.
- **Need for Mobility:** You can not wear any heavy armor (armor with protection values higher than chainmail).
- **Claustrophobia:** Being somewhere with a low ceiling for too long will weaken you and make you slower.
- **Brittle Bones:** You take more damage from falling and flying into blocks.
- **Aerial Combatant:** You deal substantially more damage while in Elytra flight.
