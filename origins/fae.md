# Fae

Fae are short magical creatures, regarded as spirits of nature and said to haunt forests and lead travelers' astray

## Characteristics

- **Allure:** Faes are naturally alluring. Unfortunately, this means that mobs will pursue them from far further away than they would other creatures.
- **Diminutive:** It is rare for a fae to break 5 feet in height. They are small creatures, even smaller than the weaselly goblins.
- **Iron Aversion:** Iron inhibits fae powers. It is unbearable for them to wear it.
- **Levitation:** Faes are known for their ability to levitate. Press G and you will begin to hover.
- **Magic Resistance:** As magical creatures themselves, faes take less magic damage compared to other creatures.",
- **Regeneration:** Faes are magic creatures. Press your secondary power key and you will regenerate health for a short period, at the cost of your hunger.
