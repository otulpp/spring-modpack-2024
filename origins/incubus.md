# Incubus

Incubi are evil servants of a dark power. Powerful in their own realm, but losing their soul has left them weak to pure sources.

## Characteristics

- **Carnivore:** An incubus' bloodlust is insatiable. If it isn't the flesh of an animal, its worthless.
- **Demon Fire:** Imbued with the devil's power, the incubus can release a burst of hell's energy on command. Triggered with secondary power key.
- **Hellborne:** Having spent eternities in the depths of hell, fire feels like home - it deals no damage to Incubi.
- **Hydrophobe:** Water scalds Incubi, damaging them on contact.
- **Impure:** Much like the undead, incubi are saturated with dark energy and can not receive healing from potions.
- **Realm Advantage:** As agents of hell, Incubi are not accustomed to Overworld dimensions and are weaker there. But they are considerably stronger in the Nether.
- **Unholy Deal:** An incubus can exchange some of their life force for raw power for a short time. Triggered with Primary Active key.
