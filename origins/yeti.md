# Yeti

Lumbering giants of frosty peaks, the Yeti's icy nature allows them to stop almost any foe, but can leave them vulnerable to fiery attacks.

## Characteristics

- **Flammable:** Yetis are susceptible to fire damage due to their wintry nature.
- **Frigid Pulse:** A powerful magic runs through the veins of a yeti, allowing them to entomb a group of foes in ice on command.
- **From Whence you Came:** Thriving best in the lands from which they originate, yetis move faster and are carried on the snow to negate fall damage in icy biomes.
- **Frosty Breath:** The frosty breath of the yeti slows any opponents which get close to them.
- **Thick Fur:** The blessing of thick fur becomes a curse in deserts. Your movement is slowed and health reduced to that of a normal person.
- **Titanic:** Yetis have far more health than a regular human.
- **Unstoppable:** Yetis are immune to the slowness effect.
- **Winter Body:** Yetis are marginally taller than a regular human, and significantly wider.
