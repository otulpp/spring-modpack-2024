# Goblin

Obsessed with gold and treasure, goblins tend to find a little more loot wherever they look, but their small size leaves them vulnerable in combat.

## Characteristics

- **Cunning:** Goblins are clever creatures who know how to find slightly more rare loot, though some say it's just luck.
- **Frail:** Due to their small stature, goblins' max health is reduced, leaving them very prone to damage.
- **Greedy:** Goblins love treasure - by simply wearing or wielding gold, they get unique benefits.
- **Nimble:** Although short, goblins are quite fast, allowing them to outrun most stronger enemies instead of fighting.
- **Stunted:** Goblins are two thirds the height of a human.
