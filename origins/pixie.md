# Pixie

Harbingers of good fortune, but agents of mischief. Tiny.

## Characteristics

- **Curse of Flight:** The wings which allow pixies to fly also prevent even the most skilled of craftsmen from creating a chestplate to accommodate them.
- **Feather Footed:** The pixie's small size means it is completely impossible for them to take fall damage.
- **Flight:** Pixies are blessed with the gift of flight.
- **Good Fortunes:** Although pixies can be troublesome, they are also associated with good luck. When mining, you will occasionally get something valuable from plain stone.
- **Mischief Maketh Man:** Pixies are capable of performing numerous mischievous acts which, if not not dangerous, are certainly loud.
- **Bitesize:** Pixies are some of the smallest creatures to roam the land, rarely reaching even the height of a regular person's knee.
- **Soaked:** Being as small as they are, water poses a significant threat to pixies. It hampers their movement and impairs their ability to fly.
- **Troublemaker:** Villagers know pixies by the legends of trouble they cause, and will refuse to trade with them.
