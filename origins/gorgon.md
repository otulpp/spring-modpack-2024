# Gorgon

Gorgons were humans cursed by the Gods. With hair made of writhing snakes and a horrifying visage said to petrify those who witness it, Gorgons are often called monsters.

## Characteristics

- **To Stone:** Gorgons were cursed with being bound in dark, dank caves. Being outside in daylight causes them to become petrified until night. Can be negated by wearing a helmet.
- **Silver Aversion:** Gorgons are weak to the purity of silver - they can not stand to wear it and take damage when wielding it. (Iron is also counted as silver)
- **Petrifying Gaze:** Meet the eyes of any mob facing you, turning them to stone briefly. Does not work on bosses or players.
- **Poisoned Blood:** Gorgons are immune to poison, and have a chance to spill their toxic blood onto nearby enemies when hit, poisoning them.
- **Revenge:** Centuries of being cursed then blamed for their misfortune has left Gorgons bitter. They deal massively increased damage at low health.
- **Hydrophobe:** Gorgons can not tolerate the purity of water and take damage from it.
