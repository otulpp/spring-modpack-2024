# Dwarf

Dwarves are practical, stocky, and prideful. They excel at mining and living underground, but struggle with the daylight. Rock and stone, brother.

## Characteristics

- **Darkness Dweller:** Dwarven eyes are adapted for the dark. Direct sunlight burns their sensitive retinas, blinding them until darkness returns. Prevented by wearing a gold helmet.
- **Dense:** Dwarves are heavy for their size; they sink in water.
- **Dwarven Tech:** Dwarves can mine significantly faster than others.
- **Stocky:** Dwarves are shorter than humans, but almost as wide as them
- **Mythril Resonance:** Powerful metals which carry the spirit of your people fill you with might.
- **Nocturnal Eyes:** Living underground has led to dwarves having highly sensitive eyes, able to see perfectly fine even in the pitch black of the caverns.
- **Photoallergic:** Dwarven skin is far too sensitive for the world outside of their mountainous cave homes, direct sunlight burns them, unless wearing a helmet.
- **Potent Brew:** Dwarves are notorious for their powerful drinks which would knock out someone twice their size. Activate to take a swig and fully restore health.
