# Necromancer

Lost in the forbidden art of raising the dead, a Necromancer can raise an army from nothing. But this morbid relationship with death comes with consequences.

## Characteristics

- **Black Thumb:** Necromancers only work with death. They cannot harvest any crops, they wilt at their deathly touch.
- **Disturbed:** Learning the art of necromancy is traumatizing. Necromancers cannot sleep, too scared to dream of what they wish they did not know.
- **Hellraiser:** At will, a necromancer can raise a circle of skeletons, blocking projectiles and damaging other opponents. Unfortunately, it only lasts for a short time.
- **Impervious:** The study of death has made Necromancers immune to poison, wither and instant damage. Unfortunately, this also means they do not recieve the positive effects from regeneration and instant health.
- **Poor Reputation:** Unfortunately, students of the dark arts are feared by the general populace. Villagers will refuse to trade with Necromancers and iron golems will attack them on sight. This does, however, come with the bonus that they are accepted amongst the ranks of the Pillagers.
- **Resilient:** Learning about death goes a long way towards avoiding it. Necromancers have increased health.
- **Unguarded:** Enveloping oneself in the arcane leaves you open to attack in the physical realm. Most mobs deal more damage to necromancers.
