# Wood Elf

Wood Elves are a wise, long-lived race in touch with the Earth. They are natural archers who excel in the forest, but are otherwise weak.

## Characteristics

- **Archer:** Elves are expert marksmen. They deal significantly more damage using a bow than other creatures.
- **Forest Vision:** After centuries in the forest, Wood Elven eyes are well adapted to be among trees and they can see clearly in them even at night.
- **Eagle Eyed:** Wood Elves' enhanced perception allows them to keep track of an enemy for a while after hitting them, even when they aren't in view.
- **Elegant:** Due to their slender nature, Wood Elves can not wear armor heavier than chainmail, and have less health.
- **Steward:** Wood elves live off the forest and in harmony with it. They can not digest meat.
- **Towering:** Wood elves are taller than the average human. Despite this, they are just as thin.
- **Graceful:** Elven arms are not as powerful, but they are quick. They deal reduced damage but attack slightly faster.
