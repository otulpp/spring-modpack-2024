# spring-modpack-2024

- > ( a super cute forge/fabric pack for spring time! ⸜(｡˃ ᵕ ˂ )⸝♡
- > Subtly inspired by; ACOTAR's Spring Court, DND 5e, Animal Crossing,
and Stardew Valley. I wanted this pack to be focused on aesthetics while also leaving room
for convience mods, a large farm/food concentration, and a layer of harder
difficulty added to the game. Attached later will be a general wiki for most of the mods compiled here if I have enough time.

{ MOD LOADER; `FORGE` \
{ MINECRAFT VERSION; `1.20.1`

- > made with the help of Packwiz and Prism Launcher (૮ ˶´ ᵕˋ ˶ა)!!! thank you to my lovely boyfriend for the emotional support on my first modpack :)

## INSTALLATION GUIDE

### usage (client)

1. Download Adoptium.

| Operating System | Download Link |
| :--------------: | :------------ |
| Windows          | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=windows&arch=x64&version=17> Use the `.msi` installer. |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=mac&arch=aarch64&version=17> Use the `.pkg` installer. |
| macOS (Intel)    | <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?package=jre&os=mac&arch=x64&version=17> Use the `.pkg` installer. |
| Linux            | Use your system package manager to install Java 17 JRE or JDK. Any distribution should work, but I like OpenJDK |

1. Download Prism Launcher from <https://prismlauncher.org>. Make sure you get the installer, not the portable.
2. Run Prism Launcher. During the installation, select the JRE you installed in step one, when it prompts you to select a Java version.
3. Click "Add Instance" and then "Import". It should look like this:

2. Press "OK".

You're done! Double click the instance to run it. The first time you run it, it'll automatically download all of the mods in the pack.
It will also prompt you to add an account, so make sure you log in with the Microsoft account associated with your Minecraft profile.
